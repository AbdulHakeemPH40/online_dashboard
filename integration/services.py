# Clean services.py - minimal setup for fresh start
# Service classes are implemented in dedicated modules:
# - PromotionService: integration/promotion_service.py
# - ExportService: integration/export_service.py
# Add new service classes here as needed for future implementations

# Note: Placeholder service classes removed as they were unused dead code
# Active services are implemented in their dedicated modules for better organization
